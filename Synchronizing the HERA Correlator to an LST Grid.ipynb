    "# Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this memo is to define the time grid in local sidereal time (LST) to which we will lock integrations from the HERA Correlator. In doing so, we also define the maximum integration time for the correlator employing baseline-dependent averaging (BDA). By locking integrations to an LST grid, we avoid having to interpolate between integrations when stacking or comparing days of observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This memo supports an upgrade to the HERA Correlator control between the H4C and H5C seasons. Prior to this memo, LST grid alignment was achieved by attempting to find a GPS-derived 1PPS (one pulse per second) close to an LST grid boundary and arming F-engines to reset their master counters (MCNTs) on that 1PPS. This system had the shortcomings that\n",
    "* the actual LST grid of the observations depended on run-time operation (i.e. it emerged from the start time rather than being pre-defined),\n",
    "* little attention was given to how evenly the chosen LST grid divided a sidereal day, and\n",
    "* there was no support for LST alignment under BDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the new system defined by this memo is to address these shortcomings and clarify the control path for implementing LST synchronization in the correlator."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The HERA correlator consists of three major subsystems: the F-Engine responsible for synchronization and channelization, the X-Engine responsible for cross-correlation and accumulation, and the data recorder that writes accumulations and meta-data to files on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "F-Engine synchronization is achieved by distributing phase-aligned sample clocks and 1PPS signals to each HERA SNAP board using a network-based synchronization system known as White Rabbit. F-Engines re-synchronize on the next 1PPS signal when an 'arm' command is sent. The timing of 1PPS relative to the LST grid is arbitrary.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the rising edge of the next 1PPS, they reset the MCNT counter which count the number of subsequent spectra. This counter is embedded in the packets output by the F-Engine and is used by the network receive buffer on the GPU-accelerated X-Engines to time-align spectra for cross-correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "After cross-correlation, visibility products are accumulated on the X-Engine for an integer number of MCNTs, as specified in configuration. We will call this parameter $MCNT\\_PER\\_GRID$. In the current (non-BDA) correlator, all accumulation buffers use this same parameter. After transitioning to BDA, the correlator will support power of 2 subdivisions of this parameter for baselines, as appropriate for their length, up to $2^4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of BDA, we usually concern ourselves with the minimum number of MCNTs per integration, but for defining an LST grid for the correlator, we are actually more concerned with the maximum integration time, since this defines the coarsest grid for alignment. Thus, for this purpose of this memo, $MCNT\\_PER\\_GRID$ is taken to be correspond to the longest integration time for which we support LST alignment."
